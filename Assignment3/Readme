# Logic Building Programs – Set 3

This repository contains a collection of C programs focused on logic building.  
Each program is implemented in a separate file using the naming convention `A3Q1.c`, `A3Q2.c`, ..., `A3Q5.c` where:
- `A3` indicates the program set
- `Q1`, `Q2`, etc., refer to the specific question number.

## Coding Standards
- Proper indentation and consistent formatting are maintained.
- Each program is contained in a dedicated file.
- Clear and descriptive variable names are used.
- The `main` function and helper (service provider) functions are modular and well-structured.
- Input validation is included where appropriate.
- Programs have been tested with a variety of inputs to ensure correctness.

## Problem Descriptions

### A3Q1: Print Even Numbers
- Accept one number from the user.
- Print that many even numbers starting from 2.
- **Input:** 7  
- **Output:** 2 4 6 8 10 12 14

### A3Q2: Display Factors
- Accept a number from the user.
- Print all of its even factors.
- **Input:** 24  
- **Output:** 2 4 6 8 12

### A3Q3: Display Only Even Factors (Also Divisible by 2)
- Accept a number from the user.
- Print only even factors of the number.
- **Input:** 36  
- **Output:** 2 6 12 18

### A3Q4: Convert Character Case
- Accept a character from the user.
- Convert its case (uppercase to lowercase or vice versa).
- **Input:** `a` → **Output:** `A`  
- **Input:** `D` → **Output:** `d`

### A3Q5: Check Vowel
- Accept a character from the user.
- Check whether it is a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`, case-insensitive).
- Return `TRUE` or `FALSE` accordingly.
- **Input:** `E` → **Output:** It is Vowel  
- **Input:** `d` → **Output:** It is not Vowel

```bash
gcc A3Q1.c -o myexe
./myexe

#  Logic Building Assignment : 1 ðŸ’¡

This repository contains five logic-building programs in C. Each file is named using the format `A1QX.c`, where `X` is the question number.

All programs are implemented with proper *C coding conventions*, including:
- Clear and meaningful function/variable names
- Proper use of constants/macros
- Consistent indentation

## ðŸ›  How to Compile & Run

Use the following commands to compile each file with a custom executable name (`myexe`) and then run it:

### ðŸ”§ Compile:
```bash
gcc A1Q1.c -o myexe      # For Question 1
gcc A1Q2.c -o myexe      # For Question 2
gcc A1Q3.c -o myexe      # For Question 3
gcc A1Q4.c -o myexe      # For Question 4
gcc A1Q5.c -o myexe      # For Question 5
